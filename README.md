# Multimodal-XAI-Lime
Dissertation submission for my MSc Data Science @ City University, London (2021).

## Overview
Evaluating the effectiveness of LIME explanations in helping human users better understand the predictions of multimodal AI models. Using a dataset from Kaggle, a Multimodal AI model is trained to
predict pet adoption speed based on online pet adoption listings containing image, text and tabular data. A custom implementation of LIME is then developed to produce multimodal
explanations for this model, and a user study is conducted to investigate the effect on user understanding.

## Repo Contents
* code - contains implementation of multimodal model and custom Lime explanations.
* report - write-up outlining theory, approach, and key results from the research.
